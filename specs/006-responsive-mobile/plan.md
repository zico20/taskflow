# Implementation Plan: Responsive Mobile & Tablet Support

**Branch**: `006-responsive-mobile` | **Date**: 2026-05-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/006-responsive-mobile/spec.md`

## Summary

Make the existing TaskFlow UI fully responsive on phones and tablets **without touching
the desktop layout (≥1280px)**. All changes are additive Tailwind responsive utilities +
a small global CSS layer + one new mobile-nav behavior. Concretely: add a viewport meta;
turn the always-present sidebar into an off-canvas drawer behind an accessible hamburger
below `md` (768px); guard against horizontal page scroll; make type fluid where it helps;
enforce 16px form inputs on mobile (no iOS zoom); add comfortable tap targets, touch
focus/active states, an `@media (hover: hover)` guard, and extend reduced-motion. **No
backend, no data model, no new runtime dependencies, no logic changes.**

The existing code already uses Tailwind responsive prefixes and has partial
`prefers-reduced-motion` handling, so this is an **incremental, low-risk** layering of
responsive rules onto known components — verified by typecheck/lint/test/build plus a
manual multi-width pass.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Frontend only — TypeScript (strict), React 18.3, Next.js 14.2
(App Router), Tailwind CSS. No backend work.

**Primary Dependencies**: Existing only — Tailwind, TanStack Query, Zustand, lucide-react,
the in-repo i18n module. **No new dependencies** (the hamburger/drawer is built from
existing primitives + a tiny local hook or CSS-only state; no UI library added).

**Storage**: N/A. The only new state is the transient open/closed state of the mobile nav
drawer (client UI state, not persisted).

**Testing**: Vitest (existing suite, incl. AR/EN dictionary-parity) + `tsc --noEmit` +
`eslint` + `next build` + a manual responsive pass at 320 / 375 / 425 / 768 / 1024 / 1280px
across Dark/Light × AR/EN (per quickstart.md). Optional: Playwright viewport screenshots.

**Target Platform**: Web (Next.js App Router frontend).

**Project Type**: Web application — frontend-only change.

**Performance Goals**: No horizontal page scroll at any width; mobile nav opens/closes
smoothly; no heavy desktop-only motion on mobile; respect reduced-motion. No added network
or bundle weight of note (utility classes + one small component).

**Constraints**:
- **Desktop boundary = 1280px (`xl`)**: rules that must not affect desktop are written to
  apply only below `xl` (e.g. `max-xl:` or unprefixed-then-`xl:`-restores), so ≥1280px is
  byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Mobile-nav boundary = 768px (`md`)**: the hamburger/drawer applies below `md`; at `md`+
  the sidebar shows.
- Additive only; reuse the existing design tokens and spacing scale; preserve RTL/LTR and
  both themes; the kanban board keeps its own contained horizontal scroll.

**Scale/Scope**: ~1 new component (mobile nav trigger/drawer or a responsive variant of
`Sidebar`), edits to `app/layout.tsx` (viewport) and `(app)/layout.tsx` (mobile nav slot),
`globals.css` (responsive global layer), `components/ui/input.tsx` (16px on mobile), and
targeted responsive class additions in the board page, boards page, dialogs, landing, and
the kanban column/board. No file is rewritten wholesale.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-checked after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Layered Architecture & Separation of Concerns | ✅ Pass | Purely presentational. The only new state (mobile-nav open/closed) is local client UI state, kept in the component (or the existing Zustand UI store) — not conflated with server state. No backend layering touched. |
| II. Test Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE) | ✅ Pass | No backend change (coverage unaffected). Frontend gates (`tsc`/`eslint`/`vitest`/`build`) stay green; AR/EN parity test guards any string additions (e.g. a "menu"/"close" aria label). No business logic changes → no new logic tests; responsiveness verified by build + manual multi-width pass. |
| III. Real-Time Consistency & Optimistic UX | ✅ Pass | Real-time/hooks untouched; only layout/CSS changes. |
| IV. Security & Privacy by Default | ✅ Pass | No auth/data/API changes. |
| V. Pragmatic Simplicity (YAGNI) | ✅ Pass | Builds the mobile nav from existing primitives (no UI library); reuses tokens/spacing; extends the existing reduced-motion block rather than duplicating. No speculative breakpoints beyond the spec's bands. |

**Result**: PASS — no violations; Complexity Tracking not required.

### Constitution alignment notes

- **Desktop-unchanged guarantee** is enforced structurally: responsive utilities are scoped
  below `xl` (1280px), so the desktop render path is identical. The plan's verification
  includes an explicit desktop-diff check (SC-003).
- **No new dependency** for the hamburger keeps Principle V; a CSS/Tailwind + small React
  state solution is sufficient.

```

**Structure Decision**: Frontend-only, additive responsive layering. The default Tailwind
breakpoints already line up with the spec's bands (`md`=768 for the nav switch, `xl`=1280
for the desktop boundary), so **no Tailwind config change is needed**. The one structural
addition is a mobile nav (hamburger + off-canvas drawer) that reuses the existing `Sidebar`
contents so there is a single source of truth for navigation. Everything else is responsive
utility classes on existing components plus a small global CSS layer. Desktop (≥1280px) is
left untouched by scoping rules below `xl`.
