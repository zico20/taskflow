# Feature Specification: Responsive Mobile & Tablet Support

**Feature Branch**: `006-responsive-mobile`

**Created**: 2026-05-30

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: Convert the existing desktop-perfect TaskFlow UI into a fully
responsive site that works flawlessly across all mobile and tablet sizes, without
altering the desktop version. Additive changes only; preserve the existing design
language, colors, typography hierarchy, and spacing. Cover small/standard/large phones,
portrait/landscape tablets; do not modify desktop (≥1280px). Requirements span layout,
fluid typography, a hamburger navigation, responsive media, touch interaction, mobile
spacing, mobile-friendly forms, and reduced-motion/performance.

## Overview

TaskFlow's interface is production-ready on desktop but does not adapt to phones and
tablets. This feature makes every screen usable and well-laid-out across all common
small screen sizes — **without changing how the app looks or behaves on desktop**. All
changes are additive (responsive rules that apply only below desktop widths); the desktop
layout, design language, colors, type hierarchy, and spacing system are preserved.

Scope covers the whole app surface already present: landing, login/signup/forgot-password,
the boards list, a board (sidebar + kanban + activity), and the dialogs (task, board
settings, manage labels, create/confirm). Real behavior (auth, boards, tasks,
drag‑and‑drop, labels, members, real-time, themes, bilingual RTL/LTR) is unchanged.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Use the app on a phone without breakage (Priority: P1)

A person opens TaskFlow on their phone (anywhere from a 320px small phone to a 767px large
phone). Every screen fits the viewport: content reflows to a single readable column where
appropriate, text is legible (never tiny), tap targets are comfortable, and **the page
never scrolls sideways**. Nothing overlaps, gets cut off, or forces pinch-zoom.

**Why this priority**: This is the core of the request — the app is currently unusable on
phones. A phone visitor being able to read, navigate, and act on every screen is the
minimum that delivers the value, and it is independently demonstrable.

**Independent Test**: Open each screen at 320px, 375px, and 425–767px widths and confirm:
no horizontal page scroll, no overlapping/clipped content, legible text, and that core
flows (log in, open a board, open/edit a task) are completable by touch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any screen on a 320–767px viewport, **When** it loads, **Then** content fits
   the width with no horizontal page scrolling and nothing is clipped or overlapping.
2. **Given** a multi-column desktop layout (e.g., the boards grid, dialog two-column,
   settings), **When** viewed on a phone, **Then** it reflows to a single column (or a
   sensible 2-column) that reads top-to-bottom.
3. **Given** body text on a phone, **When** displayed, **Then** it is never smaller than a
   comfortably readable size and uses readable line spacing.
4. **Given** the kanban board on a phone, **When** viewed, **Then** the board scrolls
   horizontally *within its own area* (expected for kanban) while the page itself does not
   scroll sideways.
5. **Given** a phone in Arabic, **When** any screen loads, **Then** it lays out correctly
   right-to-left at that width with the same fitness guarantees.

### User Story 2 - Navigate via a mobile menu (Priority: P1)

On screens narrower than a tablet, the navigation (today's sidebar) is reachable through a
clearly visible menu control (a "hamburger") rather than occupying screen width. Tapping it
opens the navigation with a smooth animation; choosing a destination, or tapping outside the
menu, closes it. The control is keyboard-accessible and labeled for assistive technology.

**Why this priority**: With the navigation rail hidden/condensed on small screens, users
still need a way to move between "All boards" and their boards. It is the companion to US1
for making the app navigable on phones, so it shares top priority.

**Independent Test**: On a <768px viewport, confirm a labeled menu button is visible; open
it (smooth animation), navigate to a board and confirm it closes; reopen and tap outside to
confirm it closes; operate it with the keyboard (focus + Enter/Escape) and confirm screen
readers announce it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a viewport narrower than 768px, **When** a screen loads, **Then** the primary
   navigation is collapsed behind a visible, labeled menu (hamburger) control.
2. **Given** the menu is closed, **When** the user activates the control, **Then** the
   navigation opens with a smooth animation and full access to "All boards", the boards
   list, and the user/theme/language/logout controls.
3. **Given** the menu is open, **When** the user selects a destination or taps/clicks
   outside the menu, **Then** the menu closes.
4. **Given** the menu control, **When** a keyboard or assistive-technology user reaches it,
   **Then** it is focusable, operable (open/close), labeled (ARIA), and dismissible with
   Escape.
5. **Given** a desktop viewport (≥1280px), **When** the app loads, **Then** the full
   sidebar is shown exactly as today and no hamburger appears.

### User Story 3 - Comfortable, mobile-friendly tablets (Priority: P2)

On tablets (768–1279px, portrait and landscape) the app uses the extra space sensibly —
between the phone single-column layout and the full desktop layout — so an iPad or iPad Pro
user gets a comfortable, well-proportioned experience rather than a stretched phone view or
a cramped desktop view.

**Why this priority**: Tablets are a meaningful slice of usage and sit between the two
extremes; getting them right polishes the experience but the app is already usable on them
once US1/US2 land. Secondary to phones.

**Independent Test**: View the boards list and a board at 768px and at 1024–1279px and
confirm the layout adapts appropriately (e.g., multi-card grids use available columns, the
board and panels are comfortably proportioned) without horizontal page scroll and without
looking like a blown-up phone.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a tablet-portrait width (768–1023px), **When** the boards list loads, **Then**
   board cards arrange into an appropriate multi-column grid that fills the width without
   overflow.
2. **Given** a tablet-landscape width (1024–1279px), **When** a board loads, **Then** the
   layout is comfortably proportioned (not a stretched phone view, not the desktop view)
   with no horizontal page scroll.
3. **Given** any tablet width, **When** navigating, **Then** navigation is reachable
   (whether via the menu control or an appropriate adapted layout) without losing access.

### User Story 4 - Touch & input quality (Priority: P2)

A touch user finds every interactive element easy to tap, gets clear pressed/focus feedback,
is never blocked by hover-only behavior, and — when filling a form — is not zoomed in
unexpectedly and gets the right on-screen keyboard for each field.

**Why this priority**: These details determine whether the mobile experience feels broken or
polished; they matter but build on the structural work in US1/US2.

**Independent Test**: On a touch device/emulator, confirm buttons/links/menu items are easy
to tap (comfortable target size), show a pressed/focus state, that no action requires hover,
and that focusing a text field does not zoom the page and shows the appropriate keyboard
(email/number/etc.).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** any interactive element on touch, **When** the user taps it, **Then** the tap
   target is comfortably large and shows a visible pressed/focus state.
2. **Given** an interaction that relies on hover on desktop, **When** on a touch device,
   **Then** an equivalent non-hover way to reach it exists and hover-only effects do not
   misfire.
3. **Given** a form field on a phone, **When** the user focuses it, **Then** the page does
   not zoom in, the field is comfortably wide, and the on-screen keyboard matches the field
   type (e.g., email).
4. **Given** a user who prefers reduced motion, **When** they use the app on mobile,
   **Then** non-essential animations are reduced or removed.

### Edge Cases

- **No horizontal scroll, ever (page level)**: At every width from 320px up, the page body
  must not scroll horizontally. The kanban board's own horizontal scroll is allowed and
  expected, contained to the board area.
- **Very small phones (320px)**: The smallest target must still fit all controls without
  clipping; long board/task names wrap or truncate gracefully.
- **Landscape phones / short viewports**: Headers, drawers, and dialogs must remain usable
  when height is limited (scroll within the dialog/drawer rather than trapping content).
- **RTL at every breakpoint**: All responsive behavior mirrors correctly in Arabic; the
  menu, drawers, and reflowed layouts respect inline direction.
- **Both themes**: Responsive layouts work in Light and Dark.
- **Long content**: Long titles, descriptions, emails, and label lists wrap/truncate without
  breaking layout or causing overflow.
- **Desktop untouched**: At ≥1280px the layout, spacing, and visuals are byte-for-byte the
  same experience as before this feature.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The application MUST render correctly across all target widths — small phones
  (320–374px), standard phones (375–424px), large phones (425–767px), tablet portrait
  (768–1023px), and tablet landscape (1024–1279px) — and MUST leave the desktop experience
  (≥1280px) visually unchanged.
- **FR-002**: All responsive changes MUST be additive — they MUST NOT alter the desktop
  layout, design language, colors, typography hierarchy, or spacing system.
- **FR-003**: There MUST be no horizontal page scrolling at any supported width; the kanban
  board's intrinsic horizontal scroll MUST be contained within the board area only.
- **FR-004**: Multi-column desktop layouts MUST reflow to a single column (or a sensible
  2-column) on phones, reading top-to-bottom, and MUST use flexible sizing so content fits
  the available width.
- **FR-005**: The app MUST declare a mobile viewport so devices render at device width with
  no forced zoom.
- **FR-006**: Body text MUST remain legible on mobile (never below a comfortable minimum
  readable size) with readable line spacing; type MUST scale fluidly between breakpoints
  while preserving the existing hierarchy.
- **FR-007**: On screens narrower than 768px, the primary navigation MUST collapse behind a
  visible, labeled menu (hamburger) control that opens/closes with a smooth animation, gives
  full access to navigation, and closes on selection or on an outside tap.
- **FR-008**: The menu control MUST be accessible — focusable and operable by keyboard,
  labeled for assistive technology, and dismissible with Escape.
- **FR-009**: Images MUST scale within their container (never overflow), below-the-fold
  images SHOULD load lazily, and any embedded media MUST preserve its aspect ratio.
- **FR-010**: Interactive elements MUST present a comfortably large tap target on touch and a
  visible pressed/focus state; hover-only interactions MUST have a non-hover equivalent on
  touch, and hover effects MUST NOT misfire on touch devices.
- **FR-011**: On mobile, excessive desktop padding/margins MUST be reduced while following a
  consistent spacing scale.
- **FR-012**: Form fields on mobile MUST not trigger zoom-on-focus, MUST be comfortably wide,
  and MUST use the appropriate input type so the correct on-screen keyboard appears.
- **FR-013**: Non-essential animations MUST be reduced or disabled for users who prefer
  reduced motion, and heavy desktop-only motion MUST NOT run on mobile.
- **FR-014**: All existing functionality (auth, boards, columns, tasks, drag-and-drop,
  labels, members, real-time, presence, activity, themes, bilingual RTL/LTR) MUST continue
  to work unchanged at every breakpoint.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

No new data entities. This feature is presentation/layout responsiveness only; it relies on
the existing screens, components, and design tokens. The relevant "states" are viewport size
buckets (small/standard/large phone, tablet portrait/landscape, desktop) and the open/closed
state of the mobile navigation menu (transient client UI state).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: At 320px, 375px, 425px, 768px, 1024px (and a representative width in each band)
  there is zero horizontal page scroll on every screen — 100% of screens pass.
- **SC-002**: Every screen is usable on a 320px phone: a user can complete log in, open a
  board, and open/edit a task entirely by touch with no clipped or unreachable controls.
- **SC-003**: The desktop experience at ≥1280px is unchanged — 0 visual differences versus
  before this feature across all screens.
- **SC-004**: On screens <768px, the primary navigation is reachable via the menu control in
  100% of sessions, and the menu opens/closes on activation, selection, and outside tap.
- **SC-005**: Body text on mobile is never smaller than the comfortable minimum, and no form
  field triggers zoom-on-focus on iOS.
- **SC-006**: Interactive elements meet a comfortable minimum tap-target size on touch across
  100% of primary actions (nav, buttons, menu items, task/board cards).
- **SC-007**: All responsive layouts render correctly in both themes and both languages
  (Dark/Light × Arabic/English) at every breakpoint band.
- **SC-008**: All existing flows pass at every breakpoint band with no functional regression.

## Assumptions

- **Presentation/layout-only**: This feature changes only how existing screens lay out at
  small widths. No backend, data-model, API, or business-logic changes; no new features.
- **Builds on the current UI**: It is layered on the already-adopted Liquid Glass design and
  Layout v2 (sidebar, drawer, grouped boards). The existing design tokens and spacing scale
  are reused; the existing `prefers-reduced-motion` handling is extended, not replaced.
- **Kanban horizontal scroll is intended**: A kanban board scrolls horizontally by nature;
  the requirement is that this scroll stays inside the board area and the *page* never
  scrolls sideways. The board is not forced into a single column.
- **Desktop boundary is 1280px**: "Desktop — do not modify" means ≥1280px; all new rules
  target widths below that.
- **Mobile navigation derives from the existing sidebar**: The hamburger menu surfaces the
  same destinations/controls the sidebar already provides (All boards, board list, user,
  theme, language, logout) rather than introducing new navigation.
- **No new images/media pipeline**: The app is largely text/SVG/icon based; the image rules
  apply to any images present and to future ones, and are satisfied by responsive sizing and
  lazy-loading conventions rather than a new asset system.
- **Bilingual + themes preserved**: All responsive work respects the existing RTL/LTR and
  Light/Dark systems.

## Dependencies

- Relies on the existing frontend screens/components and the established design-token and
  spacing systems (from the Liquid Glass + Layout v2 work) as the surface to make responsive.
